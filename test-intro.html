      A more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a
      variety of instruments that have been designed to help measure individual
      stress levels. The first of these is called the Perceived Stress Scale.
      The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment
      instrument. The tool, while originally developed in 1983, remains a
      popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect
      our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask
      about your feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you
      will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain way.
      Although some of the questions are similar, there are differences between
      them and you should treat each one as a separate question. The best
      approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to count up the
      number of times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative
      that seems like a reasonable estimate.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      For each question choose from the following alternatives: never, almost
      never, sometimes, fairly often ,very often.
